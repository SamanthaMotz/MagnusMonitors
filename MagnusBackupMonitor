#Script created by Samantha Motz - Motz Technologies LLC- Sam@motztech.com. Tested on PowerShell 5 and Windows 10. May not work on lower versions. Use at your own risk. 
#This script will check for a successful Magnus backup within the amount of days set. If it can't find one, it will check for warnings first and then errors. If no entries are found at all, it reports that as well.
#This script assumes Magnus is installed on your system drive. If it's not, you need to edit the $DriveLetter variable.
#In addition to running response code, this script creates a logs subdirectory in your install folder and creates dated logs within. 


#How far back to check logs, I recommend no less than 3 days. Less can cause error spam.

$Days = 4


#Enter your magnus software name here
$MagnusName = "YOUR BACKUP NAME HERE"


#end of custom variables

$DriveLetter = (Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).SystemDrive
